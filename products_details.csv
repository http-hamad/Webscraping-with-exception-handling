I got what was shown, but I want to tell about the seller that my chat was not responded even after a couple of days, so please make your availability there so that the customer can place the order with full sitesify. Because the amount matters But my goal was to buy the product from there, so I took what I have and it is üíØ %authentic, and the warranty has not started yet, But the handsfree did not come out of the box, maybe not provided by the company. So the Overall experience was great and the seller is highly recommended. Thanks Daraz & Seller.ü•∞

The mobile blacked out after 4 days. It is a fake product. The seller is not solving the problem. Don‚Äôt buy this is a big scam. The seller is very dishonest. It is Draz mall approved product and even the Mart is not copererating and taking any responsibility

price was reasonable but the quality of the phone is low. wifi doesn't work on it properly also it gets heated up quickly. just for normal use but at least wifi should work properly. also after returning the phone, they didn't send back the handfree.

waited for Redmi Note 12 Pro's release at Xiaomi official store, but found no confirmation. Opted for this seller, initially seeking grey, only white and blue were available. Seller was kind & arranged the grey variant. Grateful for their responsiveness and a quick 2-day delivery, increased trust in Daraz with upfront debit card payment. arrived properly sealed, PTA approved. Impressed by fast charging, phone responsiveness, clear call quality, and excellent camera results. Highly recommended üòá

Seal is broken and a local lamination packing on the box. Too much dust on the handset. Although Fone is cheaper than market price and delivery was fast but broken seal, dust on handset type things urge buyers not to shop anything from the seller next time. I asked seller in chat but he didn't respond me yet.

On the left is the dual-SIM card tray for a nano and micro-sized SIMs. On the right are the volume keys and the power/lock button.
Up top are the headset jack and the dedicated microSD card slot. Down at the bottom are the microphone, microUSB port, and loudspeaker.
Flip it on its back and you will see the 8MP camera and LED flash, a couple of antenna bands, and the Vivo branding right in the middle.
On hand, the Y55 has a size that is neither too big nor too small, which makes it comfortable to hold even those with small hands. It has a chrome lining on the edges that adds extra grip while the back has a metallic matte finish that repels smudges and fingerprints well.

I got what was shown, but I want to tell about the seller that my chat was not responded even after a couple of days, so please make your availability there so that the customer can place the order with full sitesify. Because the amount matters But my goal was to buy the product from there, so I took what I have and it is üíØ %authentic, and the warranty has not started yet, But the handsfree did not come out of the box, maybe not provided by the company. So the Overall experience was great and the seller is highly recommended. Thanks Daraz & Seller.ü•∞

An array of dual camera can be found on the back of the phone.
According to the press release, the main sensor will be 50 MP and the others have not yet been confirmed.
With the powerful MediaTek Helio G88 SoC chipset and the octa-core 2.0 GHz CPU, the Tecno Spark's 10 Pro is equipped with all the power you need to run the smartphone smoothly.
Following that, it is expected to be equipped with 8GB of RAM as well as 128GB of internal storage.
A dedicated memory card slot will then be present on the Spark 10 Pro for the purpose of expanding the memory. Currently, there is no official date that has been set for the launch of the phone.
On the new 10 Pro, you will find a bigger battery cell that will allow you to run it all day on one charge; it has a capacity of 5000 mAh.
Additionally, it has the capability of supporting fast charging as well.
